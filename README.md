# Bullet Train in Docker

You can use this repo to set up an entire [Bullet Train Feature Flag](https://bullet-train.io) environment locally. Just clone the repo and run docker-compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BulletTrainHQ/bullet-train-docker.git
cd bullet-train-docker
docker-compose up
```

Wait for the images to download and run, then visit `http://localhost:8080/`. As a first step, you will need to create a new account.
